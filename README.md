# Single file PHP album/file browser

This is a very old project. It is likely insecure and I do not recommend using it publicly.

It's essentially a file browser for media files.

## Features
- Single file!
- Image and video thumbnails
- Multiple view styles
- Multiple sorting modes
- Search
- Login

## Usage

Drop `index.php` in a directory and navigate to it in a web browser.

It probably requires PHP 7+.
